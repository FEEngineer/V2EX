### V2EX simulate

This project aims to practice front ending skill. I'll always drop halfway while learning something, but the hardest time, means I'll get more improvement. 
Three steps will be taken.
1. Write page of [V2EX](https://www.v2ex.com/), include main page, user profile page and content page.
1. Write backend, grab information of V2EX using [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs), and build everything well.
1. Refactor the site with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), aims to learn how to write frontend project with component;

The project progress hope to be within three month, for I haven't much time to spend on this project. Everyday should commit some code, win is a habbit.
